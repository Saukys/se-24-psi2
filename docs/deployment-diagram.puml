' System Deployment Diagram
' =============================================
' This diagram illustrates the physical deployment architecture of the educational game platform,
' showing how different components are distributed across various environments.
'
' Deployment Overview:
' - Client Side: Web browser-based Blazor frontend
' - Azure Cloud: Core application services and data storage
' - Development: Tools and environments for development
'
' Infrastructure Components:
' - App Service: Hosts the .NET Core API
' - SQL Database: Stores application data
' - Blob Storage: Manages game assets
' - Development Tools: IDE and testing environment
'
' Communication:
' - HTTPS for client-server communication
' - Secure data access between services
' - Deployment pipeline from development
