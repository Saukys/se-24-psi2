# Educational Game Platform Documentation

## 1. Context
### 1.1 System Overview
The Educational Game Platform is a web-based system designed to provide interactive educational games for students. The platform supports multiple game types (Finder, Reading, Block), user management, group management, and analytics.

### 1.2 Planned Changes
- Implementation of new game types
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Improved group management features
- Enhanced security measures
- Performance optimizations

### 1.3 Stakeholders
- Students (end users)
- Teachers (group administrators)
- Institution Administrators
- System Administrators
- Developers

## 2. Logical View
### 2.1 Information Model
- [Class Diagram](class-diagram.puml)
  - Core domain entities (User, Game, Score, Group)
  - Service interfaces (IGameService, IScoreService, IUserService, IGroupService)
  - Repository interfaces (IGameRepository, IScoreRepository, IUserRepository)
  - External integrations (IEmailService, SmtpEmailService)

### 2.2 Data Model
- [Database Schema](database-schema.md)
  - User data model (authentication, roles, progress)
  - Game data model (types, rules, sessions)
  - Score data model (points, timestamps, rankings)
  - Group data model (memberships, statistics)
  - Analytics data model (progress, achievements)

### 2.3 Business Rules
- Game rules and scoring (defined in Game class)
- User roles and permissions (player, institutional_admin)
- Group management rules (active, inactive, archived states)
- Achievement system rules (unlock conditions, points)

## 3. Development View
### 3.1 System Decomposition
- [Component Diagram](component-diagram.puml)
  - Frontend components (GameController, ScoreController, UserController)
  - Backend services (IGameService, IScoreService, IUserService, IGroupService)
  - Database access (AppDbContext, Repository implementations)
  - External integrations (IEmailService, SmtpEmailService)

### 3.2 Module Organization
- Presentation layer (Controllers)
- Business logic layer (Services)
- Data access layer (Repositories)
- External services layer (Email, Analytics)

### 3.3 Common Design Elements
- Error handling (standardized error responses)
- Logging (application and security logs)
- Security (authentication, authorization)
- Performance optimization (caching, indexing)

## 4. Process View
### 4.1 Threading Model
- [State Diagrams](state-diagram.puml)
  - Game state management (initializing, playing, completed)
  - User state management (active, inactive, blocked)
  - Group state management (active, inactive, archived)

### 4.2 Synchronization
- Concurrent access handling (database transactions)
- Resource locking (game sessions)
- Transaction management (score processing)

### 4.3 Process Flows
- [Sequence Diagrams](Sequence/)
  - [Game Session Flow](Sequence/sequence-game-session.puml)
  - [Score Processing Flow](Sequence/sequence-score-processing.puml)
  - [Group Management Flow](Sequence/sequence-group-management.puml)
  - [Authentication Flow](Sequence/sequence-auth.puml)

## 5. Physical View
### 5.1 Deployment Architecture
- [Deployment Diagram](deployment-diagram.puml)
  - Client devices (browser-based)
  - Application servers (App Service)
  - Database servers (Data Storage)
  - External services (Email Service)

### 5.2 CI/CD Process
- Build process (automated builds)
- Testing process (unit, integration, system tests)
- Deployment process (staged deployment)
- Monitoring process (performance, security)

### 5.3 Technical Requirements
- Hardware requirements (defined in deployment diagram)
- Software requirements (defined in deployment diagram)
- Network requirements (defined in deployment diagram)
- Security requirements (defined in security guidelines)

## 6. Use Case View
### 6.1 System-Level Use Cases
- User registration and authentication (sequence-auth.puml)
- Game playing and scoring (sequence-game-session.puml)
- Group management (sequence-group-management.puml)
- Analytics and reporting (sequence-score-processing.puml)

### 6.2 Validation
- Unit testing (service layer)
- Integration testing (API endpoints)
- System testing (end-to-end flows)
- Performance testing (response times)

## 7. Traceability
### 7.1 Requirements Mapping
- Functional requirements (mapped to sequence diagrams)
- Non-functional requirements (mapped to deployment diagram)
- Technical requirements (mapped to class diagram)
- Security requirements (mapped to security guidelines)

### 7.2 View Dependencies
- Logical to Development view (class diagram → component diagram)
- Development to Process view (component diagram → sequence diagrams)
- Process to Physical view (sequence diagrams → deployment diagram)
- Physical to Use Case view (deployment diagram → use cases)
